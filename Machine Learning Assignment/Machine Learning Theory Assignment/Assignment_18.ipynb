    "**Ans:** The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not. Unsupervised learning models,  in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data.\n",

    "**Ans:** The various types of clustering are:\n",
    "- **Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering):** Hierarchical Clustering is a method of unsupervised machine learning clustering where it begins with a pre-defined top to bottom hierarchy of clusters. It then proceeds to perform a decomposition of the data objects based on this hierarchy, hence obtaining the clusters. This method  follows two approaches based on the direction of progress, i.e., whether it is the top-down or bottom-up flow of creating clusters.\n",
    "          \n",
    "          \n",
    "- **Centroids-based Clustering (Partitioning methods):** Centroid based clustering is considered as one of the most simplest clustering algorithms, yet the most effective way of creating clusters and assigning data points to it. The intuition behind centroid based clustering is that a cluster is characterized and represented by a central vector and data points that are in close proximity to these vectors are assigned to the respective clusters.  \n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "- **Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods):** If one looks into the previous two methods that we discussed, one would observe that both hierarchical and centroid based algorithms are dependent on a distance (similarity/proximity)  metric. The very definition of a cluster is based on this metric. Density-based clustering methods take density into consideration  instead of distances. Clusters are considered as the densest region in a data space, which is separated by regions of lower object density and it is defined as a maximal-set of connected points.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Distribution-based Clustering:** Until now, the clustering techniques as we know are based around either proximity (similarity/distance) or composition (density). There is a family of clustering algorithms that take a totally different metric into consideration – probability. Distribution-based clustering creates and groups data points   based on their likely hood of belonging to the same probability distribution (Gaussian, Binomial etc.) in the data.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       \n",
    "- **Fuzzy Clustering:** The general idea about clustering revolves around assigning data points to mutually exclusive  clusters, meaning, a data point always resides uniquely inside a cluster and it cannot belong to more than one cluster. Fuzzy clustering methods change this paradigm by assigning a data-point to multiple clusters with a quantified degree of belongingness metric. The data-points that are in proximity to the center of a cluster, may  also belong in the cluster that is at a higher degree than points in the edge of a cluster. The possibility of which  an element belongs to a given cluster is measured by membership coefficient that vary from 0 to 1."

    "**Ans:** \n",
    "```python\n",
    "The k-means algorithm determines the consistency of clustering by iteratively updating cluster centroids and assigning data points to the nearest centroid until convergence. Here's how the algorithm works and how it assesses the consistency of clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization: The algorithm starts by randomly selecting k centroids, where k is the number of clusters specified by the user.\n",
    "Assignment Step: Each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric, commonly the Euclidean distance. This step forms initial clusters.\n",
    "Update Step: The centroids of the clusters are updated by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "Convergence: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively until either the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached. This signals convergence.\n",
    "Now, to determine the consistency of clustering, we look at two aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within-cluster variation (WCSS): This metric measures the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid within a cluster. Lower WCSS indicates tighter clusters, which often implies better consistency.\n",
    "Between-cluster variation: This refers to the distance between centroids of different clusters. Larger distances typically indicate better separation between clusters and thus more consistent clustering.\n",
    "The k-means algorithm aims to minimize WCSS by iteratively adjusting cluster assignments and centroids. A lower WCSS suggests that data points within the same cluster are closer to each other, indicating more consistent clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, k-means does not guarantee finding the globally optimal solution, and the quality of clustering can be sensitive to the initial placement of centroids. Therefore, it's common to run the algorithm multiple times with different initializations and choose the clustering with the lowest WCSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the consistency of clustering in the k-means algorithm is assessed based on minimizing the within-cluster variation and maximizing the between-cluster variation, resulting in tight and well-separated clusters.\n",
